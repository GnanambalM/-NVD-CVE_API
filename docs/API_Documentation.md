# CVE Management API ‚Äì Documentation

This API provides access to CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) data synchronized from the [NVD API](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers).  
It supports filtering, validation, sorting, and mitigation suggestions.

üõ°Ô∏è Data Quality & Sync

Data is fetched in batches from NVD API.

Deduplication is ensured via PRIMARY KEY (CVE ID).

Dates are normalized to YYYY-MM-DD.

Scores validated between 0‚Äì10.

CVEs refreshed periodically (default: every 24 hours).

üîÆ AI-Powered Mitigation

Each CVE includes a mitigation field with recommended remediation strategies.

Rule-based logic matches common vulnerability patterns (SQLi, XSS, RCE, etc).

Extensible to use AI/ML models for intelligent suggestions.

Example

{
  "id": "CVE-2023-56789",
  "description": "Buffer overflow in ...",
  "cvss_score": 8.5,
  "mitigation": "Apply vendor patches, enable DEP/ASLR, and use memory-safe libraries."
}
